📊 Outlier Detection and Removal using Z-Score Method
This project demonstrates how to detect and remove outliers from a dataset using the Z-Score Method, a common statistical approach. It includes a complete workflow using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, with clear visualizations before and after outlier treatment.

📁 Project Overview
Outliers can significantly skew the results of data analysis and machine learning models. In this notebook, we:

Load and inspect the dataset

Visualize distributions of key features (cgpa, placement_exam_marks)

Apply the Z-Score method to detect and remove outliers

Compare the distributions before and after cleaning

🧠 Concepts Covered
Z-Score formula and application

Statistical reasoning behind outlier detection

Data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib

Handling and filtering DataFrames with conditions

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization

📌 Key Sections
Exploratory Data Analysis

Initial overview of distributions using histograms

Z-Score Calculation

Outlier detection based on thresholding with standard deviations

Outlier Removal

Creating a filtered dataset excluding high Z-Score values

Post-Cleaning Analysis

Comparing cleaned vs original distributions

📷 Example Plots
